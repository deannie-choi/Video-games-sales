## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python (Pandas)
- SQLite
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau

## ðŸ“Š Key SQL Analyses

1. **Average Sales by Genre**
   - Platform, Shooter, and Sports genres have the highest average sales.
2. **Platform Trends Over Years**
   - Sales spikes observed for platforms like Wii and PS2 during specific years.
3. **Top 3 Titles by Publisher**
   - Nintendo and Rockstar have the most commercially successful top titles.
